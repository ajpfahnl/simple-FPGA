# Simple FPGA Verilog Projects

This repository contains several projects of practical digital design. The projects are simulated on the Nexys3 Board (containing a Xilinx Spartan-6) using the Xilinx ISE.

Lab descriptions:

 1. [Floating point converter](1-FPCVT/report.pdf).
 2. [Clock design](2-clock/report.pdf).
 3. [Vending machine FSM](3-vendingFSM/report.pdf).
 3. [Parking Meter FSM](4-parkingFSM/report.pdf).

Read the reports under each project folder for a more detailed descrption of the projects.
